<h1>Pizza Shop Ordering System</h1>

The specifcation required the creation of a Pizza Shop Ordering System that would support generic menu items as well as specific pizza orders.

Each 'Menu Item' would have shared instance variables and methods with all menu items as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type - including methods to accommodate bespoke pizzas with strict ordering regulations.

This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, interfaces, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.

A driver class PizzaShop would also be required to facilite user orders being printed and to provide information, such as vegetarian options, to customers - using parameterised methods.
